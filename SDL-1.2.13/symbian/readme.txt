To get started, please run "configure.bat", it generates standard SDL test applications for S60 and should provide

In test folder sos_test is an example of S60 spesific SDL code, average SDL developer
should not need that. More detailed documentation can be found at www.mbnet.fi/~mertama/sdl.html
